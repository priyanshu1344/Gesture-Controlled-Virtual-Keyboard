# Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Keyboard

This Python script harnesses the power of computer vision and hand tracking to create a sophisticated virtual keyboard with gesture control. By integrating the OpenCV library and a custom `HandTracker` module, the script captures real-time hand movements through a webcam. The hands' landmarks, including fingertips and thumbs, are meticulously tracked, enabling precise interaction with the virtual keyboard. The keyboard consists of individual keys, each represented by a `Key` object and strategically positioned for optimal usability. Users can dynamically press keys using their fingertips, and the system responds to gestures, detecting fingertip distances for nuanced control. The virtual keyboard features essential functionalities such as text input, backspace, clear, and space, displayed in a text box on the video feed. A toggleable "Show/Hide" key enhances user control, providing flexibility in interaction. The script also integrates an "Exit" key for seamless application closure. Notably, the FPS display offers insights into real-time performance monitoring. This project showcases a harmonious blend of computer vision, user interface design, and gesture-based interaction, offering a unique and engaging user experience.
